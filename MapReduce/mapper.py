#MapReduce based solution to integrate with www.bealstreasure.com
#to work on finding counterexamples to Beal's conjecture.
#That is, find positive integers x,m,y,n,z,r such that:
#x^m + y^n = z^r and m,n,r > 2 and x,y,z co-prime (pairwise no common factor).

#ALGORITHM: Initialize the variables table, pow, bases, powers such that:
#        table.get(sum) = r if there is a z such that z**r = sum.  
#        bases = [1, 2, ... max_base]
#        powers = [3, 4, ... max_power]
#Then enumerate x,y,m,n,	and do table.get(pow[x][m]+pow[y][n]).  
#If we get something back, report it as a result.  We consider all 
#values of x,y,z in bases, and all values of m,n,r in powers.
